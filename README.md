# Overview

The 24 card game is an application that allows the users to see the numbers on 4 cards and try to use these 4 digits to equate to 24. The user is able to see multiple hands and see if their answers are correct.

## Refreshing

Resets the hand of cards giving a new hand of cards. Changing the display shown and the underlying values of the 4 cards.

## Inputs

Input a 4 digit code into the bar on the bottom. Then when selecting verify it will parse the equation (to the best of my ablities, parenthesis currently do not work as intented and 2 digit numbers sometimes cause problems) and display the output of the given equation following the order of operations.

## Outputs

Outputs whether or not there is a solution to the given equation. It is very rare that an equation does not possess a solution.
